Education and training - Female
-	Cover’s 90% of NSW.
-	Huge escalations in educational and training occupations along the east coast of NSW whilst inland Wilcannia, Broken Hill, Swan 
Hill, Hay, Griffith, Warren, Parkes, West Wyalong.
-	The space of land occupied by the this industry reflects the growth in population, both young and in job opportunity. 
Education - Male
-	Covers a small amount of NSW, primarily across the east coast, with only a few places inland.
-	These are: Balranald, Ivanhoe, Hay, Cobar, Boorke, West Wyalong and Brewarina.
-	Locations where Males work within education and training are all dominated by women when inland. It reflects that in the efforts 
of expanding NSW’s population out west is lead by the efforts of women in educating and training the youth and workers. 
Construction – Female
-	A minimal amount of females work in construction across NSW. The stereotype is clear that there is more men working in the 
industry, however, there are high spikes in females. These areas are saturated across the east coast in dense cities like Sydney, 
Wollongong and Newcastle. These areas being primary cities with an population of 7.70 million in NSW is increasing by 1.2% per year. 
Therefore, it house the rise of citizens, work in construction is required to build apartments in suburban locations, close to work 
opportunities.
Construction - Male
-	Covering huge portions of NSW, construction as an occupation for males greatly shadows over females within the business. 
-	Sydney is saturated by construction, yet in comparison to the west, construction is seen to be a primary job for males. 
Again this is due to large numbers of new house and apartment villages being developed for population expansion. 
Mining – Female
-	Mining is quite minimal for females. Mining is seen in Cobar quite largely, Lightning Ridge, Parkes out in the west. Whilst, 
seeing spikes with females in the occupation, areas such as Orange, Wollongong, Sydney, Newcastle and Branxton.
-	Cobar, Nyngan have the highest amount of females working in mining one given location.
Mining – Male
-	Mining is dominated by males across NSW. Out west in areas like Cobar, Nyngan, Mildura and Lightning Ridge. These areas are being 
typically mentioned often, showing a spark in expansion for residents and resources to thrive.
-	There are spikes across the east coast, seeing high activity in Wollongong, Jervis Bay, Marulan, Penrith, Gosford, Newcastle, 
Borambil, Tamworth and Tingha.
Connections:
-	It can be noted that the following areas are prominent locations in hosting the three industry sectors: Broken Hill, Lightning Ridge, 
Cobar, Griffith, Wagga Wagga, West Wyalong, Newcastle and Wollongong. Cobar with only a population of 3,990 in the 2016 census is a mining 
designated town with high tourism in the caravan business. Therefore, it makes sense as to why mining and construction are so highly 
situated there; as a means of economic resource and to build towards better tourism venues for caravan parkers. Cobar with a population 
of 17,814 is steadily declining. With 10.2% of its population in mining, it is that along with health care and retail trade that drives 
the town to survive economically. Hence it’s spike on the map.
